title: Repository Best Practices
---

To ensure that we adhere to general community expectations, there are some common requirements we have within eBay's open source code.

## README

You MUST to have a `README` file. It should cover what the project is, why someone might want to use it, and general instructions on how to use the thing. You may also want to include badges at the top, like your travis-ci build status, code coverage, etc.

The format of this file isn't important, but we often use markdown.

## LICENSE

You MUST have a `LICENSE` file. It should be the license that you have previously discussed with the open source / legal team, prior to open sourcing it.

## Contributing

You may want have a `contributing.md` file. It provides instructions to people who would like to contribute code. If you have one, you probably want to include:
- How to get a development environment setup
- How to run the tests
- Any PR/commit formatting requirements
