title: Licenses
---

While all projects require approval from the Committee, inbound & outbound projects licensed under the following licenses will more likely be approved with less license scrutiny and can be considered eBayâ€™s preferred, "green" licenses:
- MIT
- Apache 2.0
- BSD-2
- Creative Commons

These licenses are considered on a case-by-case basis (significant review, audit, and benefit-to-risk assessment) and are considered "yellow":
- LGPL

Projects associated with the following licenses are not likely to be approved by the Committee, e.g. "red":
- GPL
- AGPL
- SSPL
- MPL
- EPL
